# OpenAPI 2 Skill
### Generate agent skills from OpenAPI API definitions

Creates [agentskills.io](https://agentskills.io) format documentation/skills so AI agents can discover and call your API.

[![CI](https://github.com/scosman/openapi2skill/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/scosman/openapi2skill/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

## Why Skills and not MCP?

OpenAPI specs can have thousands of endpoints. MCP wrappers immediately flood your context with too many tools when your agent probably only needs a few of them. With an Agent Skill we can have progressive disclosure:

 - Describe the API's purpose and tags in the main SKILL.md
 - List available APIs for each tag in `references/TAG_api_list.md`
 - Give detailed API spec for each API in `references/get_user.md` (see [example](#example-api-definition) below)

Your agent only loads the information is needs, not the entire API. Your agent can call these APIs using any tool you like, often just `curl`.

## Installation

```bash
git clone git@github.com:scosman/openapi2skill.git
cd openapi2skill
uv sync
```

## Usage

```bash
uv run openapi2skill --spec <url-or-file> [--preamble <file>] [--output <dir>]
```

### Arguments

| Argument | Required | Default | Description |
|----------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `--spec` | Yes | - | URL or file path to the OpenAPI JSON spec |
| `--preamble` | No | Built-in default | Path to a markdown file prepended to SKILL.md |
| `--output` | No | `./output` | Directory where skill files are written |

### Examples

From a URL:
```bash
uv run openapi2skill --spec https://api.example.com/openapi.json
```

From a local file:
```bash
uv run openapi2skill --spec ./openapi.json --output ./docs
```

With a custom preamble:
```bash
uv run openapi2skill --spec ./openapi.json --preamble ./preamble.md
```

## Output Structure

Each run creates a timestamped subdirectory:

```
output/
  2026-03-19_143052/
    SKILL.md
    reference/
      get_users.md
      post_users.md
      get_users_id.md
      ...
```

### SKILL.md

Contains a summary table of all endpoints grouped by tag, with links to detailed reference files.

### Reference Files

Each endpoint gets a detailed markdown file with:
- Path and query parameters
- Request body schema with field types and constraints
- Response schemas for each status code
- Examples (when available in the spec)

#### Example API Definition `references/get_users.md`

```md
# Get User

**GET /api/users/{user_id}**

Retrieve a user's profile by their ID.

## Path Parameters

| Name | Type | Required | Description |
|------|------|----------|-------------|
| user_id | string | Yes | The user's ID (e.g. `usr_4kQx9mP2`) |

## Responses

### 200 OK

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| id | string | Unique user ID (e.g. `usr_4kQx9mP2`) |
| email | string | User's email address (e.g. `jane@example.com`) |
| name | string | Full display name (e.g. `Jane Smith`) |
| created_at | string | ISO 8601 signup timestamp (e.g. `2024-01-08T09:15:00Z`) |
| role | string | One of: `admin`, `member`, `viewer` |
| active | boolean | `false` if the account has been deactivated |

### 404 Not Found

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| error | string | Human-readable message (e.g. `User not found`) |
```


## Requirements

- Python 3.13+
- OpenAPI 3.x JSON spec (YAML not supported)

## Development

Run tests:
```bash
uv run pytest
```

Lint and format:
```bash
uv run ruff check .
uv run ruff format .
```

## Alternative

Also see [neutree-ai/openapi-to-skills](https://github.com/neutree-ai/openapi-to-skills) for a similar tool. I made mine because 1) I didn't see theirs until after, 2) I wanted fewer reference file hops. 

Theirs breaks out each schema into separate files. Loading a single API it might require 5 file-reads to get needed schemas into context. Which approach is better depends on your usage. When agents only need only 1 or 2 APIs per session, the method used by this project is faster and uses fewer tokens. When agents load many APIs with overlapping schemas, theirs is faster and uses fewer tokens.
